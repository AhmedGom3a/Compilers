*Parser Project:

1- Program takes local input file of your choice 
  that containes "Scanner output lines".

2- Program can't handle empty lines "unneccessary lines should be removed"
  so please check the lines at the end and the begining of input file.

3- semicolon as a special symbol is very important for recognizing
  the end of an expression.
4- program can't handle big expressions in case of the "condition" of "if"
   ,for example:
	if x-1 > 0  : not working example
	if x > 0 : working example
	if 2 = z : working example
5- for small screens the program may wrap the tree so
   we have colored the main tree elements in black
   so that you can recognize them easily,or you may hover over an element to
   see it's sub tree
6- you can also zoom out to see the full tree arrangement and zoom in for details.
