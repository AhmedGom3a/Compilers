*Parser Project:

1- Program takes local input file of your choice 
  that containes "Scanner output lines".

2- Program can't handle empty lines "unneccessary lines should be removed"
  so please check the lines at the end and the begining of input file.

3- semicolon as a special symbol is very important for recognizing
  the end of an expression.
4- program can't handle big expressions in case of the "condition" of "if"
   ,for example:
	if x-1 > 0  : not working example
	if x > 0 : working example
	if 2 = z : working example
